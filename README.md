# ReinforcementLearning
 
Trying to understand how RL works

## Draft
The policy moves the entity which is in an environment

Therefore the policy takes in an entity and an entity takes in an environment
or should we take in the entity into the environment instead?

entity
    - every entity has an environment
    - move
    - get current state
    - get current reward

environment
    - show current state
    - show rewards
    - return reward for a state?
    - possible states

policy
    - calculates the value function
    - calculate the best action from value funtion
    - takes action for the entity
    - get the reward from the entity -> environment?
